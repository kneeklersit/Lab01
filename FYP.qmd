Here's a deep dive into my Final Year Project, where I developed a POC of digital E-wallet payment system called "Container Pay"

## Objectives
- Container Pay is a company that manages transactions between depots and hauliers using a set of integrated applications

## Project Deliverables
- A secure E-wallet system to manage transactions between depots and hauliers
- Intuitive and User-Friendly interfaces for IOS and Android and APis for target to interact with the system.

## Problem Statement
- Currently,  there isnâ€™t any secure and digitized payment system for hauliers and depots. In order to solve this, we created a proof-of-concept of a secure E-wallet and payment system that allows seamless transactions between hauliers and depots.
